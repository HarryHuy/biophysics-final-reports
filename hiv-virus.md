* **Protease**: an enzyme that cuts or cleaves protein
* **Nucleocapsid**: core structure of virus, consisting of nucleic acid surrounded by a coat of protein
* **Tat**: a regulatory protein

* **Viral**: (adj) virus
* **Virion**: a single individual particle of a virus

## Overview
* HIV is a lentivirus causes immuno-deficience.
* The infection occurs by the transfer of blood, semen, vaginal fluid, pre-ejaculate, breast milk.
* HIV infect vital cells in human immune system such as helper T cells (CD4+), macrophages, dendritic. Causing low levels of CD4+ by pyroptosis, apoptosis, direct viral killing infected cells and CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes.

## Classification
Species|Virulence|Infectivity|Prevalence|Inferred origin
---|---|---|
HIV-1| High| High| Global| Common chimpanzee
HIV-2| Lower| Low| West Africa| Sooty mangabey

## Structure and genome
![The HIV Genome](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/HIV-genome.png)
* Different from other retroviruses with a roughly spherical about 120nm of diameter, around 60 times smaller than a red blood cell.
* Composed of two copies positive **single-stranded** RNA codes for 9 genes enclosed by a **conial capsid** composed of 2000 copies of viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins p7 with supporting enzyme reverse **transcriptase**, **protease**, **ribonuclease**, **integrase**.
